## Value For Myself
I've found it useful to write down a very simple shortform work diary & Notes. It also helps me to pick up where I've left off when I work on fragmented hours and with collecting links to resources that are easy to misplace.

## Value For You
No value whatsoever. Go read the [RFC](./RFC.md) instead.

## Notes
  - Put on a singalong [playlist](https://youtube-playlist-randomizer.bitbucket.io/?pid=PLPX6lu9kG1JXtN3eWYd5AaNOpJG2GqeCP&autostart)
  - Download the project, read through all docs, get acquainted with NestJS fundamentals.
    - Look at prior art from forks. Might be useful to figure out the details around setting up tests, logging etc whenever I get stuck or need to look up coding style or idiomaticism.
      - [Richard](https://github.com/richardfarago/coding-challenge) 
        - **The only one who actually ended up working at Weld**
        - Uses kanye quotes, most likely chosen since it is funny, doesn't need auth AND the result is not static (less logic to write)
        - Didn't logically split the adapter from the worker

      - [Bartozs](https://github.com/b-michalkiewicz/coding-challenge)
      - [Ashkay](https://github.com/akshaydk/coding-challenge)
    - Randomly browse through [NestJS docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps)
  - Draft [an RFC](./RFC.md) with some broad direction. Kristian said that its important for them, that I clearly define intent and what "the end goal" is.
    - Will use [IQAir API](https://api-docs.iqair.com) to aggregate Weld office air quality data
      - Requires a free API key, must remember to provide one to Kristian via Saltify.io
    - Did quite a lot of research regarding making resilient supervision trees in NestJS. 
      - Sidenote: Oh boy, am I spoiled by working with BEAM for 2 years ðŸ˜¢. This whole project fits into like 2 files in Elixir and offers way better guarantees.
      - Can't use NestJS processes or queues because they don't offer shutdown monitoring from the perspective of the supervisor - in other words, the workers won't be restarted if they crash.
      - The docs on microservices reveal that its just a simple wrapper arounds comms, not a process manager.
    - Picking a transport protocol ain't easy. Some actions require a message and some an event. Seems doable.
    - I got stuck in a loop there. There are a lot of unknowns and not a lot of constraints, so i wrote an essay on alternative solutions. Never feels good.
  - Started by making the environment work. On my current setup, I exclusively develop within containers so I have to add node dockerfile and setup scripts.
    - Ha, had to add `node_modules/.bin` to the path.
    - For some reason that eludes me, node claims that port 3000 is taken.
      - `lsof -i :3000` turns out the nest app tries to take the same port 2x.
      - Thats because I didn't have the correct setup for the microservice config
  - Finished the RFC. Did some Figma drawings, was quite fun.
    - Spend like 5 hours on that. Need sleep.
  


TODOS:
  - use nestjs config or a set of consts
  - parametrize ports
  - figure out how logging works
  - create external api endpoints
  - Postman export
  - Swagger api docs
  - ...
