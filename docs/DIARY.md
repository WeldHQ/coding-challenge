## Value For You

None whatsoever. Please go read the [RFC](./RFC.md) instead.

## Value For Myself

I've found it useful to write down a very simple shortform work diary & Notes. It also helps me to pick up where I've left off when I work on fragmented hours and with collecting links to resources that are easy to misplace.

## Debugging Notes

- Put on a singalong [playlist](https://youtube-playlist-randomizer.bitbucket.io/?pid=PLPX6lu9kG1JXtN3eWYd5AaNOpJG2GqeCP&autostart)
- Download the project, read through all docs, get acquainted with NestJS fundamentals.
  - Look at prior art from forks. Might be useful to figure out the details around setting up tests, logging etc whenever I get stuck or need to look up coding style or idiomaticism.
    - [Richard](https://github.com/richardfarago/coding-challenge)
      - **The only one who actually ended up working at Weld**
      - Uses kanye quotes, most likely chosen since it is funny, doesn't need auth AND the result is not static (less logic to write)
      - Didn't logically split the adapter from the worker

    - [Kasper](https://github.com/kasperhangard/coding-challenge)
    - [Bartozs](https://github.com/b-michalkiewicz/coding-challenge)
    - [Ashkay](https://github.com/akshaydk/coding-challenge)
  - Randomly browse through [NestJS docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps)
- Draft [an RFC](./RFC.md) with some broad direction. Kristian said that its important for them, that I clearly define intent and what "the end goal" is.
  - Will use [IQAir API](https://api-docs.iqair.com) to aggregate Weld office air quality data
    - Requires a free API key, must remember to provide one to Kristian via Saltify.io
  - Did quite a lot of research regarding making resilient supervision trees in NestJS.
    - Sidenote: Oh boy, am I spoiled by working with BEAM for 2 years ðŸ˜¢. This whole project fits into like 2 files in Elixir and offers way better guarantees.
    - Can't use NestJS processes or queues because they don't offer shutdown monitoring from the perspective of the supervisor - in other words, the workers won't be restarted if they crash.
    - The docs on microservices reveal that its just a simple wrapper arounds comms, not a process manager.
  - Picking a transport protocol ain't easy. Some actions require a message and some an event. Seems doable.
  - I got stuck in a loop there. There are a lot of unknowns and not a lot of constraints, so i wrote an essay on alternative solutions. Never feels good.
- Started by making the environment work. On my current setup, I exclusively develop within containers so I have to add node dockerfile and setup scripts.
  - Ha, had to add `node_modules/.bin` to the path.
  - For some reason that eludes me, node claims that port 3000 is taken.
    - `lsof -i :3000` turns out the nest app tries to take the same port 2x.
    - Thats because I didn't have the correct setup for the microservice config
- Finished the RFC. Did some Figma drawings, was quite fun.
  - Spend like 5 hours on that. Need sleep.
- Its a brand new day lets figure out how config works.
  - Changing logger for a custom one, so that future changes can be made more easily
  - Luckily, the NestJS ecosystem has a nice JSON logger that people smarter than me have written.
  - Removed the middleware in favor of pino
- Write a simple middleware for error formatting
- Learn how to communicate with the worker
- Validation and config as an extensible DTO
- Useful snippets for microservice management: https://www.architect.io/blog/2020-09-08/creating-microservices-nestjs/
- I started making an adapter, but i first need to handle the error cases, worker crashes when i return axios error???
  - microservices must return a grpc...
  - There is some weird behaviour from async and non async functions regarding catching exceptions. I am not entirely sure, but so far it seems that when a function is async, its exceptions happen outside the current stack, and have to be caught manually instead of the filter
- Axios errors are a bit unpredictable. Implemented an axios utility fun
- Working on setting up some basic e2e test cases
  - This guide helped [A LOT](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57315466/e2e-testing-a-microservice-in-nest)
- Fighting with worker tests where I have to use the same connection twice
  - IDK, i gave up. Need to do things that bring actual value.
- Lets see how [Swagger api docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) works.
  - Needs a newer nestjs version. Updating... LEEEEROY JENKINS
  - I've lost the logger after the update. -.-
  - Ha, it actually worked fine, i just had to restart the webpack watcher

TODOS:

- Add a pretty hero png Nico illustrated
- Results could be persistent across restart with the simple use of NestJS cache module.
- Figure out how NestJS releases work. It seems there is more to it than compiling and running.
- da napisem kako se swagger pali i kako se projekat pali u readme

QA:

WOULDBENICES:

- Results API pagination
- Use iso8601+tz Date objects instead of timestamps
- Inconsistency in naming of classes, files and folders
- Had to force node env on jest. Don't know why.
- Have parametrized logger level control
- Should add a response facade on endpoints considered semi-public instead of returning raw worker responses.

MAJOR ISSUES:

- Figure out the exact difference in throwing behaviour between async and sync functions.
- It seems that TS doesn't do runtime argument/return typechecks. Makes sense, but whats the point then?
